# Multi-agent Systems using (Arduino) ESP32
Demystifaction through making

## Lets crash from a great height
Multi-agent systems (MAS) is without doubt an hot topic in computer science research which attracts mathematicians and philosophers to the scores of conferences on the subject. They even pretend to know software engineering. But I doubt many software engineers even know about MAS, let alone know about real-life (visible) implementations. And I believe that the blame squarely lies on the largely snobbish research community which quite freely uses phrases like "only a question of implementation" or as an habit denigrates any established sofware engineering and programming methodology as "legacy".
But amongst the hoity-toitty, there are also many who have done ground-breaking work with the sincere hope of bringing some order to the nasty world of programming things in a distributed system.

## Why me?
I have been programming control systems (paid) and robots (mostly unpaid) for quite that many years where stupidity begins to crystalize nicely. After learning FORTRAN to program numerical methods to solve problems in mechanical engineering (you can guess when the crystalization started), I discovered the pleasure of doing things outside the box -- in my case, I got hold of a Zilog microcontroller board. If you have managed to read up to here, I guess you know the rest of the story. We are all the same pathetic lot -- debugging I2C rather than working on crypto. So, I think I can give you a short and honest story about MAS and why I think it could make some difference.

## How?
Instead of redirecting your browser to a bunch of readmes and tutorials on MAS, I will give you a gist of it here. The philosophers and mathematicians have surely left the show by now, so there will be no cringing. Then I want you to grab hold of and ESP32 board (and M5Stack stuff if you have one) and try things out. Why ESP32? (and that too with Arduino) Well, there is no doubt that your Dopamine levels will be be massive with an Atmel or ST microcontroller and GNU ARM compiler. But lets face it, unless you smell Atmel chips as your day job, getting things working with such stuff is not going to happen in an hour or so. However polluted you feel about ESP32 and Arduino, keep your ego to the side for a moment. And I know, your attention span is less than 10 mins.
